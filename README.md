# fama-french-project
## Background
The Fama-French Three Factor Model (Fama-French Model) is an expansion of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) developed by William F. Sharpe. The purpose of the Fama-French model is to compute the returns of a stock through 3 factors: the Size Premium, Value Premium, and Market Risk Premium. In general, small-cap companies with higher book to market values generate higher returns. 

## Overview
The goal of this project was to apply the Fama-French model to forecast the expected stock price returns of 4 technology companies 10 days into the future. The companies analysed included Apple, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM. 

The data on each company's stock prices were sourced from Yahoo Finance and constituted 35 years of daily stock price data.

It was hypothesised that Intel and IBM would produce higher predicted returns because they were smaller companies in terms of market capitalization and had higher book to market values than Apple and Microsoft (at the time of writing). 

## Findings and Further Research
The initial hypothesis was correct as Intel and IBM did produce higher predicted returned returns.

Future areas of exploration could include an analysis of the Carhart Four Factor Model or an investigation into the Fama-French Five Factor Model.
